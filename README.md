### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a student in ATU- completing the Higher Diploma in Software Development programme. Some of the projects for the course are contained in the following repositories.

- Object-Orientated Software Development-2021 Filtering-an-Image-with-a-Convolution-Kernel. The Image Filtering System V0.1 is a program that provides many image editing features for raster images. It uses a matrix , 2D array of numbers that slides across the pixels and makes computations changing the value of each pixel. The program allows users to select an image an apply different filters. It displays a four option menu, where users can choose an image, see the different filters available and select the desired filter and the last option allows the user to quit the program.

- Advanced Object Orientated Software Development-2022. Develop a Java application that can parse a file or a URL to generate a PNG (portable network graphics) file with a word-cloud displaying the most prominent words in decreasing font size, style and colour. 

- Computational-Thinking-With-Algorithms-Project-2022 Benchmarking sorting algorithms in Java. Reviewing various comparison and non-comparison sorting algorithms, describing how each algorithm works and considering concepts such as their time and space complexities, performance and stability.

- Web-Applications-Development-Project-2022 A simple business website using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and the JavaScript library D3 for some basic data visualisations. Linked pages and user login.

- Database Design & Development 2022: The aim of this project was to design and construct a database that could be implemented in a commercial database management system. The given narrative was used to create a relevant database that could be used to facilitate the smooth workings of a dental practise.

- Network-Technologies-Project-2022 Design and implement a network-based chat application in Java, using the Java Socket API. The program is used to transfer data from Client to Server. Furthermore, it includes additional functionality for implementing multi user chat server using Java TCP Socket programming. The project contains the client program â€“ ChatClient â€“ that implements the client side functionality and The Server program â€“ ChatServer â€“ that facilitates the server-side functionality
